Web Development Project: Match Me
Overview
Match Me is my capstone project for CODE:You. Itâ€™s a picture matching game designed for both children and adults, providing cognitive benefits such as improved memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills. The game demonstrates key concepts of web development, including the use of:

- HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries)

- JavaScript

- Node.js

- Unsplash API

- Express.js

Code Highlight
A rewarding challenge in this project was implementing the card matching logic. Using JavaScript, I created a function to compare selected cards, check for matches, and manage game state. This involved precise handling of array manipulations and API-provided image data.

Features Utilized
Node.js Web Server
- Created with Express.js to serve three HTML files.

Unsplash API Integration
- Fetches images to display as cards in the game. Each session dynamically fetches new images, enhancing replay value.

Data Management
- Arrays and objects are utilized to manage game-related data efficiently.

Tech Stack
-Frontend: HTML, CSS (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries), JavaScript

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js

- API: Unsplash API

Design Choices
- Color Palette: Bright, playful colors for user engagement.

- Font Stack: Sans-serif fonts for a modern and clear appearance.

- Responsiveness: Ensures compatibility across desktops and mobile devices.

Prerequisites
Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Visit Node.js to download and set them up.

API Information: Steps to Obtain an API Key

Future Plans and Reflection
Working on Match Me has been an incredible journey that enhanced my skills in third-party API integration and frontend-backend communication. In the future, I plan to:

Add user authentication for saving player scores.

Implement different difficulty levels by increasing card count.

Enhance design with card flip animations.

This project taught me the value of debugging and breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, building my confidence in tackling web development challenges.
